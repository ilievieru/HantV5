            <h3 class="chaptersTitle">The problem</h3><br>

            <p>We have the following environment, a hospital, who is equipped with IoT enabled devices capable of
                monitoring the environment and detecting foreign substances, smoke, water/gas leaks, temperature,
                earthquakes, etc.</p>
            <p>We need to implement a system that will interact with the IoT devices, collect data from the devices,
                analyse it and create an evacuation plan in case an emergency is detected in the hospital.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Requirements" class="requirements" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">Requirements</h2><br>
            <p>The system should have the following properties:</p>
            <p>- should be able to interact with a broad types of devices and monitor all connected devices</p>
            <p>- the system should be able to filter the data from devices to get only the relevant data</p>
            <p>- the system should be able to process the relevant data and decide if an emergency has occured</p>
            <p>- in case of emergency the system should take action and notify the personnel and aid in the evacuation
                process</p>
            <p>- because the system receive sensitive data all communication between system and device should be
                secured</p>

            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">Abstract</h2><br>
            <p>Hant or Hazard Smart Assistant is a system that helps certain entities to evacuate a number of persons
                from a building in
                case of hazards.</p>
            <p>It provides alerts to rescue teams, such as firemen, police officers and at the same time is
                capable of helping with the rescue by providing an evacuation/rescue plan to be used by the victims or
                rescue teams. It relies on data provided by the hospital and it is capable to work with multiple
                hospitals at once without great computational effort.</p>
            <p>Considering that each hospital is equipped with sensors tracking the environment, we will build a
                knowledge-based system
                that will make decision to help police department, fire department, medical staff and others, to make
                the fastest evacuation possible.</p>
            <p>Also, to make something like this possible we will need to know the position of each patient and his
                medical condition. Based on this
                information the system will prioritize evacuation in some scenario.</p>
            <p>To make our system even more precise, we will use specific information, from DBpedia and schema.org</p>
            <p>This is a multi-device application, to be used with ease, and will have real-time response to, almost,
                any possible situation.</p>
            <p>Critical data, plus various statistics, will be available via a SPARQL endpoint, and also real-time data
                will be saved, so the decision
                making algorithm and the planner, can be improved.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Introduction" class="chapters" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In order to create such a big system, we divided the structure in five main components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Core</li>
                <li>MicroServices</li>
                <li>Planner</li>
                <li>Building plan</li>
                <li>Storage</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/ClassDiagram.jpg" width="100%" height="50%" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <p>The core of this application is written in java, it is the module that makes the decision and integrates
                the other components.</p>
            <p>MicroServices will be written in NodeJs, and their main purpose is to send streams of date to the
                engine.</p>
            <p>For the storage layer we will use Apache Jena, and SPARQL queries to save and read critical data when we
                will need.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="MicroServices" class="chapters" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">MicroServices</h2>
            <p>This module is one of the most important modules because it provides the date on witch the system will
                make decision.</p>
            <p>In this application, this data will be simulated, but the represent the actual sensors and other devices,
                that will send data to
                the core. This data will be in a Json format, so it will fast and easy to read on the core.</p>
            <p>At this point we decided that we should have a specific set of MicroServices.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fire sensor</li>
                <li>Temperature sensor</li>
                <li>Motion sensor</li>
                <li>Luminosity sensor</li>
                <li>Leak sensor</li>
                <li>Bracelet</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Core" class="chapters" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">Core</h2>
            <p>This module is the heart of the application, and because of that it has more then one features.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Receives data from MicroServices</li>
                <li>Makes a prefilter of data received</li>
                <li>Update data</li>
                <li>Send data to UI</li>
                <li>Decision making</li>
                <li>other</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To explain better what this component does we created a business process management diagram. </p>
            <img src="img/Core.jpg" width="100%" height="50%">
            <p>First step is to receive data from MicroServices and read them. To receive data we created a rest
                endpoint.
                After we receive a stream of data, we read some specific data for every device, and if we consider that
                those data
                are relevant we continue by creating an instance of that device and send it further to decision
                making.</p>
            <p>Every device that sends data to core, has an entity defined in java, so we could work with objects, not
                with streams of
                data. Also this objects will be saved in database, but sometimes not in their actual format. So, to save
                only relevant data,
                we created a Transformer, witch will adapt the device entity in an entity that can be saved.</p>
            <p>Basically after the system reads date from streams, decides if those data ar relevant or not. If they are
                not relevant
                we move on to clear the stream. If they are relevant we sent them to decision making.</p>

            <!-- <h2>External resources</h2>
             <p>
                 We rely on external resources to monitor not only internal hazards but event natural ones.
                 To check for storms or other environmental dangers we use the NOAA's Severe Weather Data Inventory
                 site that lets us detect any major dangers approaching a certain hospital's location.
             </p>
             <p>
                 To extract knowlege from patient databases or any kind of medical information we use the WIKIDoc
                 site.
             </p>
             <p>
                 We also use an REST API that every hospital must implement in order for out application
                 to comunicate with it. We use this because it eases the way we access and search for data in
                 each hospital.
             </p>
 -->
            <h3>Public API</h3>
            <p>
                We implemented an API that the information generated by the app could be distributed and seen
                from various sources, browse, mobile app, etc. This API permits the visualisation of certain key
                informations such as the plans for entering and exiting any rooms, the state of the building,
                state of the people inside and an evacuation plan. This public API is a layer on top of our Internal
                API that uses it and restricts some of the users input. In other words it encapsulates the code used
                to make the computations and can only get the code generated after processing and also send some
                messages to modify within reason the data in the internal module.

        <section id="BuildingPlan" class="chapters" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">Building Plan</h2>
            <p>This part is not a very complex one, but it is very important. Building plan has a crucial importance,
                because it will represent the
                basic input for out planner, and decision making algorithm. If this part encounters some issue, there is
                a strong possibility that
                the hole system to fail.</p>
            <p>Our challenge here is to find an optimal way to represent the building.</p>
            <p>For start we thought to try represent this building as an hierarchy of object, witch will contain precise
                information,
                and enough information for our purpose</p>

        </section>

        <section id="Storage" class="chapters" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">Storage</h2>
            <p>This module is responsible for read and write data used in application.</p>
            <p>For this we used Apache Jena framework and Sparql.</p>
            <p>At this point we decided to store all of date in xml and rdf files. After we saved data in these files,
                we use
                Sparql to interrogate these files and extract the date we need.</p>
            <p>More then this, we will use this file as description for entities in our application. For example if we
                want to know more
                about a person, witch is register in our server, we will access the about feature witch will return the
                xml file associated
                with that person. </p>
            <p>To create this files we needed an ontology. For all the patients we could use FOAF ontology, but we had
                some
                special cases and we had to extend FOAF and create another ontology named "PatientOntology". </p>
            <p>This ontology can be found under apache jena package in our project, or you can find it at
                http://localhost:8080/PatientOntology.txt</p>
            <p>Also we needed an ontology for our devices/ sensors. First we thought to use SSN ontology, but it wasn't
                applicable on our data. </p>
            <p>Instead of extending this ontology to, we decided to create a new one, from scratch, but following the
                example
                of SSn ontology</p>
            <p>This one can also be found under apache jena package, or you can find it at
                http://localhost:8080/SensorOntology.txt</p>

        <section id="Results" class="requirements" typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2 class="chaptersTitle">Results</h2><br>
            <h3 class="chaptersTitle">Microservices</h3>

            <p>We implemented a set of templated microservices. There are enough devices emulated to be able to simulate
                an emergency scenario.
                We added scripts for configuring as many instances as needed. These instances are then automatically
                started. In this way we automate the way we handle the network of devices.
                One implemented microservice can span as many instances as needed and then used in creating a network of
                devices.
            </p>
            <h3 class="chaptersTitle">Core</h3>
            <p>This is the main module that integrates with all other components and orchestrates them in order to
                achieve our goal.
                Itâ€™s responsibilities are the following:
            </p>
            <p>- Listen for device data changes</p>
            <p>- Collect and filter the data</p>
            <p>- Manage and Monitor for changes in sensor values that are significant</p>
            <p>- Send an alarm to the UI component that displays the state and handles user interaction or other methods
                of countering the emergency</p>

            <h3 class="chaptersTitle">UI</h3>
            <p>We also created a tool to create building plans and to allow the user to map detected IoT devices to the
                newly created building plan.
                Besides this, we also modeled a UI-like interface to expose activities of the current system. When an
                alert launches this would show us the room in which the device has been triggered.
            </p>

        <section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods">
            <h2>Further improvments</h2>
            <p>
                Because we can not take the information from any real hospital we must implement a simulation to be used
                in the testing
                of our app. The simulation must consist of several test cases with different levels of danger. For
                example we can simulate
                a medium size fire that can grow from room to room in some random timeframe. We must consider other
                possibilities as
                single source multiple source, the material that is burning, etc. We also have to simulate patients
                inside the hopsital
                and sensors that gives us real time data to check the system for bugs and performence.
